        Like most people, family is super important to me.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I am not at school, I live with my mom and sister.
        My mom's name is Karen and she also grew up in Maine.
        <br>
        She works with kids who need extra help wen transitioning into elementary school.

        My dad, Matthew, is from Maine as well. He has been a police officer
        <br>
        for over twenty years. He has worked as a school
        <br>
        resource officer and is currently a crime scene investigator.

        Much of my other family lives in North Carolina in an area
        <br>
        called the Outer Banks. This is my dad's side of the family
        <br>
        including his parents and brothers with their kids.
